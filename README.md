# Stock Analysis with VBA
## Overview of Project
Stock analysis created to compare multiple years of performance to better make informed investment decisions. In this analysis we used 2017 and 2018 source data to compare performance of individual stocks.
In the future, Steve may want to perform his analysis on larger datasets, and he wants to know how fast his VBA code will compile the results.
### Results
We were able to refactor the macro to perform faster by not having the macro comb through each row of data when it didn't match the evaluated ticker.
#### Summary
After refining and refactoring the original code script we were able to update the macro by removing an extra loop and this helped the new macro to run and perform more quickly and more acurately to what we were trying to accomplish. Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you arenâ€™t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient and helpful in general. Refacoring is advantageous by simplifying the process though one disadvantage is that you will run a higher risk to developing more bugs and errors.
